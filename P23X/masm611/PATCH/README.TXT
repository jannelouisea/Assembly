ml613.exe       Q177759 PATCH: MASM 6.13 Patch Available        Updates a MASM version 6.11, 6.11a, 6.11d or 6.12 installation to version 6.13.

MASM 6.13 includes support for the Intel Pentium Pro processor, the Intel MMX architecture, and AMD 3D Technology.  

Due to changes in the MS-DOS extender used in earlier versions of MASM, MASM 6.13 does not run on Windows 3.1x or MS-DOS. Either Windows NT or Windows 95 is required to run MASM 6.13. If you are working in MS-DOS or Windows 3.1x, you need to continue using version 6.11d. 

Note that you can use MASM 6.13 to develop applications that run under MS-DOS or Windows 3.1x.
