  0000:0000   1K     A series of double-word addresses that form the
   through           interrupt vector table. These addresses occur
  0000:03FF          at multiples of 4 bytes (0000h, 0004h,
                     0008h...). Addresses in the table correspond
                     sequentially with software interrupts컴0000h
                     with interrupt 00h, 0004h with interrupt 01h,
                     etc.

                     Not all addresses in the table point to
                     interrupt service routines. Some point to areas
                     of nonexecutable data. Other addresses are
                     null, indicating the interrupt is not used. Do
                     not call interrupts that do not have table
                     entries that point to valid interrupt routines.

                     Always disable interrupts with CLI before
                     changing the contents of these locations.
                     Reenable interrupts with STI. \aThe Set Interrupt\v@21h.25h\v

                         service (\aInterrupt 16h\v@16h\v) receives a request for a
                         request for a key, it retrieves the key codes
                         from the buffer head, then changes the value in
                         0000:041Ah to point to the next key code pair in
                         buffer.

  0000:041C   1 word     Points to tail of circular keyboard buffer. When
                         the keyboard handler (\ainterrupt 09h\v@9h\v) detects a
                         keystroke, it places a word identifying the key
                         into the buffer at this position. The value at
                         0000:041Ch is then reset to point to the next
                         open position in the buffer.

                         If no available space remains, the buffer is
                         full, and the handler beeps the speaker to alert
                         the user. Since the tail is not reset in this
                         case, the most recent keystroke is effectively
                         ignored.

  0000:041E   16 words   Default circular keyboard buffer. Holds up to 15

                         1-byte scan code and a 1-byte ASCII code. The
                         keyboard handler (\ainterrupt 09h\v@9h\v) places the most
                         recent key identifier at buffer tail; \ainterrupt 16h\v@16h\v
                         reads the least recent key identifier from the
                         buffer head. When head = tail, buffer is empty.

  0000:043E   1 byte   Flags for disk drive recalibration. Bits 0-3
                       correspond to disk drives A, B, C, and D,
                       respectively. If bit = 0, corresponding drive (if
                       it exists) requires recalibration. Determine number
                       of disk drives attached to system by invoking
                       \aInt 11h (Get Equipment Configuration)\v@11h\v.

  0000:043F   1 byte   Flags for disk drive motor activity. Bits 0-3
                       correspond to disk drives A, B, C, and D,
                       respectively. If bit = 1, corresponding drive
                       motor is running.

                       After accessing a drive, the disk controller does
                       not turn off the drive motor. Instead, the timer
                       routine (\ainterrupt 08h\v@8h\v) turns off the active
                       motor only after a certain time elapses, ensuring
                       that the motor remains running during the brief
                       intervals between rapid disk accesses. This reduces
                       wear on the motor mechanism and eliminates time
                       spent waiting for the motor to regain operating

  0000:0440   1 byte   Count for disk drive motor shut-off. Default is 37

                       routine (\ainterrupt 13h\v@13h\v) sets this value
                       from second byte of the Disk Drive Parameter Table
                       after accessing the disk drive.

                       The timer routine (\ainterrupt 08h\v@8h\v) continually
                       decrements the count at 0000:0440h. When the count
                       reaches 0, the timer routine shuts off the motor
                       and clears bits 0-3 at 0000:43Fh (see above).

                        For example, the normal MDA cursor shape uses
                        lines 11-12 of the 14 scan lines (0-13) that form
                        the character box. In this case, 0000:0460h
                        contains the value 0B0Ch. Changing this value does
                        not change cursor shape.

                        other adapters.

                        The MDA and CGA mode registers provide write-only
                        access and cannot be read directly. To keep other
                        processes (such as BIOS) informed of the
                        register's contents, programs that reset the
                        register should record the new value at 0000:0465.

  0000:0466   1 byte    Current value in CRT controller's color register
                        at port address 03D9h. Used only for CGA but
                        emulated by EGA, MCGA, and VGA adapters.

                        The color register, like the mode register

  0000:046C   1 dword   Timer tick counter, incremented by one at each
                        timer interrupt. Initialized at system startup to
                        number of ticks since midnight. When count reaches
                        equivalent of 24 hours (1800B0h), it is reset to 0
                        and flag at 0000:0470h is set to 1.

  0000:0470   1 byte    Set to 1 at midnight. Indicates whether timer tick
                        count (see above) has been reset for another day.

                        NOTE: This value is not cumulative and does not
                        indicate the passage of successive 24-hour

  0000:0478   4 bytes   Loop counters for LPT1 and LPT2. These counters
                        determine the number of times the printer
                        service (\ainterrupt 17h\v@17h\v) attempts to poll the
                        printer for a not-busy signal. If the signal is
                        not received within the given number of tries,
                        \ainterrupt 17h\v@17h\v returns AH=1, indicating a

                        14h) attempts to read the modem or line status
                        registers. If the desired status is not

                        \ainterrupt 14h\v@14h\v returns an appropriate error code
                        in AH.

  A000:0000   Varies   Video buffer for graphics modes 0Dh and higher.
                       Used by MCGA, EGA, and VGA.

  B000:0000   0800h    Video buffer for monochrome text display (mode 7).
              words    Each word of the buffer corresponds to a single
                       character box on the screen, beginning with the
                       upper left corner.

                       The high byte of each word contains the character's
                       "display attribute," a value that specifies the
                       character's video appearance, intensity, and blink
                       state. The low byte contains the character's ASCII
                       code.

                       For example, a value of 0141h in the fourth word of
                       the buffer produces an underlined "A" (ASCII 41h)
                       at the fourth column of the screen's top row.

                       In Hercules monochrome graphics mode, memory from
                       address B000:0000h to B7FF:FFFFh holds graphics
                       data for display page 0.

  B800:0000   2000h    Video buffer for color display. Color text words
                       display (modes 0-3) is mapped in attribute/ASCII
                       word pairs as described above for monochrome text,
                       except that each display attribute determines a
                       character's background and foreground colors.

                       The buffer provides space for four screen pages in
                       80-column text mode, each page occupying 800h words
                       of memory, or eight screen pages in 40-column text
                       mode. Adapters such as the EGA and VGA provide more
                       buffer area and can accommodate more screen text.

                       In CGA graphics modes (modes 4-6), bit data in the
                       buffer corresponds singly or in pairs to individual
                       screen pixels. In Hercules monochrome graphics
                       mode, memory from address B800:0000h to BFFF:FFFFh
                       holds graphics data for display page 1.
